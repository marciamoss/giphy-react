# GIPHY-REACT

**Live App Link https://polar-dusk-95704.herokuapp.com/**

*   This application uses the GIPHY API to display first gif returned based on users search term.

*   When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif animates. If the user clicks the gif again, it stops playing.

* To run the app locally clone the repo and run `yarn install`

* Once install is done run `yarn start` and that should launch the react app in your browser.
